# NVDA-Stock-Forecast

The goal of this project was to get some hands on experience in Python within the field of Finance. To do this I wanted to attempt the age old task of predicting stock prices, specifically by using only historical data, and not considering fundamental analysis or other influencing factors such as the news. I began by extracting data from yfinance, then I did some basic data exploration and visualization using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly. Here I found that I waned to continue to use the 2y time frame of data as I believe it accurately represents some of the current volatility in the market in our post covid-19 environemnt.
